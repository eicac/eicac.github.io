Making the world’s first polarized Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) a reality is a massive and complex project that requires intense collaboration and partnership with experts across the U.S. and around the world. From building the accelerator and the detector to planning infrastructure and managing the project itself, the EIC relies on a vast array of skills and specialists.  

In just the past few months, members of the global scientific community and close supporters of the EIC have come together at two major meetings to plan the next steps to make the EIC — a groundbreaking project first conceived 22 years ago — a reality.  

First, from May 6-7 in Rome, representatives from 12 countries attended the first internationally hosted EIC Research Review Board (RRB) meeting — a gathering designed to strengthen global cooperation and detail the operational plans for the EIC detector’s construction and scientific objectives.  

Then, on May 21, during the 15th International Particle Accelerator Conference (IPAC’24) in Nashville, Tennessee, the EIC Accelerator Collaboration held a kick-off event.  

“The EIC continues to build momentum as we increase the rate of technical progress and the participation of the worldwide community of scientists and accelerator experts,” said EIC Project Director Jim Yeck of the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory. “Our international partners continue to solidify their interests and support for EIC.”...
