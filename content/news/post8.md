Dr. Tatiana Pieloni, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), has taken on the role of international co-chair of the EIC Accelerator Collaboration. Pieloni assumes the responsibilities of this role previously held by Carsten Welsch of the University of Liverpool. 
 
This prestigious appointment recognizes Pieloni's outstanding contributions to accelerator physics and extensive experience in international scientific collaboration.

“It is an honor to join the EIC project at such a pivotal moment,” said Pieloni. “I look forward to collaborating with colleagues worldwide to push the boundaries of physics and contribute to the success of this innovative project, which will certainly pave the way for even more ambitious research and the development of future accelerators.”

A renowned expert in beam dynamics and accelerator science, Pieloni has been at the forefront of numerous high-profile projects at CERN and EPFL, driving innovation in particle accelerator technology. 
 
Her leadership and technical expertise will be instrumental in advancing the EIC, a groundbreaking facility that aims to unlock the secrets of quantum chromodynamics by exploring the fundamental structure of matter with unprecedented precision.
 
The mission of the collaboration is to provide a discussion forum and a collaboration vehicle for the EIC accelerator-related working groups and topics; identify and create opportunities for institutions to contribute to the EIC construction project; identify and provide accelerator research and development topics and opportunities; and communicate to various long-range planning panels. 
 
The success of this endeavor depends on strong global collaboration. Dr. Pieloni’s appointment underscores the commitment to fostering scientific partnerships that transcend borders. 

“We extend our warmest congratulations to Dr. Pieloni on this well-deserved recognition and look forward to her leadership in shaping the future of the EIC project,” said Andrei Seryi of Jefferson Lab and the co-chair of the EIC Accelerator Collaboration from the project side. 
 
“Her expertise and vision will undoubtedly play a crucial role in ensuring the project's success and advancing our understanding of the fundamental forces of nature,” said Seryi.
