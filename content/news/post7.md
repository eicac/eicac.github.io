The EIC Accelerator Partnership Workshop 2021 – Promoting Collaboration on the Electron-Ion Collider – was hosted by TRIUMF Laboratory, Canada. The virtual meeting has taken place from October 26 to October 28, 2021, and included a half-day satellite meeting on October 29. Similar to the first partnership workshop hosted by the Cockcroft Institute last year, the 2021 workshop included sessions spread around different time zones. 

This meeting was one of the several earlier meetings that built up the foundation for organization of the EIC Accelerator Collaboration.
