The momentum for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), the world's first fully polarized electron-ion collider, is building as experts from around the globe gather to push the boundaries of nuclear physics.

On May 21, during the 15th International Particle Accelerator Conference (IPAC’24) in Nashville, Tennessee, the new EIC Accelerator Collaboration was formally launched through a kick-off event, opened by Joanne Hewett, director of Brookhaven National Lab.

Nearly 200 accelerator experts convened to learn about the unique challenges and exciting opportunities that the EIC presents. The accelerator collaboration is essential for the design and construction of a collider that meets and possibly even exceeds the recommendations of the U.S. National Science Advisory Committee Long Range Plan and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences' requirements. Jim Yeck, EIC project director from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Brookhaven National Laboratory, emphasized the importance of this gathering.

“Momentum is building for this momentous project, the first of its kind, as more international partners solidify their interest and support for EIC,” Yeck said. This sentiment was echoed by many during the event, highlighting the global enthusiasm for the project...
