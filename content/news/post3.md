The role of the EIC Accelerator Collaboration in shaping the Electron-Ion Collider was discussed in the leading Accelerator News website. 

Particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN have previously revolutionised our understanding of physics, leading to breakthrough discoveries such as the Higgs boson, a vital building block of our universe. But little is known about how quarks and gluons form the core of nearly all visible matter. 

The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a next generation accelerator that is being developed to explore the fundamental structure of matter and to understand the glue-like force field that binds the universe together. It will be constructed at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) in the US on the basis of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and consist of two intersecting accelerators: one producing an intense beam of electrons, the other one a high-energy beam of protons or heavier atomic nuclei, which are steered into collisions...
