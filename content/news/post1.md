This is the very first post!

# This is a title

This is some more text in the post

## Smaller title

### Even smaller

#### Even smaller

Here is an example of **bolded text**, an example of *italicized text*

Here is some code on a separate line:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(`hello ${i}`);
}
```

And this is `inline code` or an identifier for something `important`

Here is some LaTeX on a separate line:

$$ 
\int_{a}^{b} x^2 dx 
$$

And this is inline math: $x^2 = \mu$
