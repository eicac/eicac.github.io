The EIC design, construction, and future upgrades offer exciting scientific and technical challenges, creating opportunities for closely connected worldwide accelerator R&D. The EIC Accelerator Collaboration will help realize the full potential of these opportunities. This will benefit the EIC project, collaboration partners, and the wider accelerator community. It will also help maximize the ultimate performance of the EIC facility on the long-term. 

The EIC Accelerator Collaboration has been launched with the above described goals in mind in 2024 at the kick-off meeting at IPAC. 

The EICAC is steered by two co-chairs, an international co-chair and the project co-chair, and its structure includes the International Collaboration Board, presently represented by more than 20 institutions worldwide. The EICAC Charter is available here – [https://indico.jlab.org/event/834/](https://indico.jlab.org/event/834/) 

The EICAC was co-chaired by Prof Carsten Welsch, University of Liverpool, who served as the first inaugural international co-chair till Oct 2024, and is presently co-chaired by Prof Tatiana Pieloni, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. The co-chair from the EIC project is Andrei Seryi, Jefferson Lab.
