The design, construction, and future upgrades of the EIC present exciting scientific and technical challenges, creating opportunities for a closely connected global accelerator R&D community. The EIC Accelerator Collaboration will help realize the full potential of these opportunities, benefiting the EIC project, its collaboration partners, and the wider accelerator community, while also maximizing the long-term performance of the EIC facility.

The EIC Accelerator Collaboration was launched in 2024 at the IPAC kick-off meeting, with the goals outlined above in mind.

The EICAC is led by two co-chairs—an international co-chair and a project co-chair—and its structure includes the International Collaboration Board, which currently represents more than 20 institutions worldwide. The EICAC Charter is available [here](https://indico.jlab.org/event/834/) 

Originally co-chaired by Prof. Carsten Welsch of the University of Liverpool, who served as the inaugural international co-chair until October 2024, the international co-chair position is now held by Prof. Tatiana Pieloni from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. Andrei Seryi from Jefferson Lab serves as the co-chair representing the EIC project.
