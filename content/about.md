The design, construction, and future upgrades of the EIC present exciting scientific and technical challenges, creating opportunities for a closely-connected global accelerator R&D community. The EIC Accelerator Collaboration will help realize the full potential of these opportunities, benefiting the EIC project, its collaboration partners, and the wider accelerator community, while also maximizing the long-term performance of the EIC facility.

The EIC Accelerator Collaboration was launched in 2024 at the IPAC kick-off [meeting](https://indico.jlab.org/event/834/), with the goals outlined above in mind.

The EICAC is led by two co-chairs—an international co-chair and a project co-chair—and its structure includes the Institutional Collaboration Board, which currently represents more than 20 institutions worldwide. The EICAC Charter is available [here](https://indico.jlab.org/event/834/) and the structure of the ICB will be available here (the link to Indico page will be added).

The international co-chair position is presently held by [Prof. Tatiana Pieloni](https://people.epfl.ch/tatiana.pieloni?lang=en) from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. Wolfram Fischer from Brookhaven National Lab serves as the co-chair, representing the EIC project. [Prof. Carsten Welsch](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/people/carsten-welsch) of the University of Liverpool and Andrei Seryi from Jefferson Lab served as the inaugural EICAC co-chairs.
